
# Troubleshooting Parts

--> During the predicting features in flask_app, we have to reshape 
    into 2D array, even we are predicting just one sample 
    bcz scikit-learn models are designed to handle multiple samples at once


--> Some time We have to rename columns name to conviently work with 
    dataset using pandas rename method

--> To build the applications on models, we have to save the current state
    of model using pickle module.
